# Interpreter
## I was inspired by Dr.Crawley of Lipscomb University to look more into programming languages. This is my attempt at now trying to make an interpreter.
___
  This repo follows the work of me figuring out how to make an interpreter for the lox language. It also follows the book *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystorm.
At the end of this project I hope to have greater knowledge to create an even better compiler for the slic language that I worked on in my undergrad studies under
the guidence of Dr. Crawley at Lipscomb University 2024.
